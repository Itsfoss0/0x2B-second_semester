## Intro 
Digital multimedia refers to the use of computer technology to store, manipulate, and distribute various forms of media, such as text, images, audio, and video. Some key concepts in digital multimedia include compression, which is the process of reducing the size of multimedia files in order to make them more manageable and easier to transmit; multimedia authoring, which is the process of creating interactive multimedia content; and multimedia standards, which are guidelines for encoding and decoding multimedia data. Other concepts include streaming media, which allows multimedia content to be delivered in real-time over the internet, and multimedia databases, which are used to store and retrieve multimedia data
